This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that includes Tailwind CSS, TypeScript and Jest with @testing-library with working TS path aliases.

## Getting Started

You can run a development environment simply by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

For testing, run:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

For an optimized production build, run

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file and Tailwind CSS will auto-generate classes as you add them.
